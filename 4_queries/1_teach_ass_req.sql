Total Teacher Assistance Requests

Get the total number of assistance_requests for a teacher.

-Select the teacher's name and the total assistance requests.
-Since this query needs to work with any specific teacher name, use 'Waylon Boehm' for the teacher's name here.

My solution.

SELECT  count(*) as total_assistances ,teachers.name as name
FROM assistance_requests
JOIN teachers ON teacher_id = teachers.id 
WHERE teachers.name = 'Waylon Boehm' 
GROUP BY teachers.name;
